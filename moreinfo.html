    <h1>the mods inside the game</h1>
    <p>
      battle royale is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players,<br />
      allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of
      three or four players).<br />
      Weaponless players airdrop from a "Battle Bus" that crosses the game's
      map, and then scavenge for weapons,<br />
      items, and resources while trying to stay alive and to attack and
      eliminate other players.<br />
      Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size
      due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage
      and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate.<br />
      This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player
      encounters until the last player or team is alive.<br />
